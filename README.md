# Bank_Note_Authentication

### Problem Statement
 To distinguish  genuine and forged banknotes.Data were extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes using Neural Network models

For this project I am using the [Bank Authentication Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) from the UCI repository.

 ### Dataset Description
* variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* entropy of image (continuous)
* class (integer)

Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

### ML algorithm used
Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Self Organizing Map, Linear Vector Quantization
